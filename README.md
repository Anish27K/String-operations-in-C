# String-operations-in-C
In this repository, we will learn how to implement certain modifications in a string 
The code is divided into 4 sections, each containing different modifications we can do on a string in C without using any predefined function. 

Section 1 : In this section we find the length of a string in C without using the predefined function that is 'strlen()'.

Section 2 : In this section we will convert the case of a string using ASCII codes. We do this as we know that the difference between lower and upper case letters is 32.

Section 3 : In this section, we will find the number of words,vowels and consonants in a string. This is done through the basic knowledge of vowels and consonants and implementing the word counter by checking the blank space (' ')  in a string with an additional condition of not allowing more than one consecutive space to be counted. 

Section 4 : In this section, we will reverse the string. This could be done using two different methods : 
                                                              Using temp variable 
                                                              Without using temp variable 

We are implementing the second method that is without using a temp variable and hence preserving memory space.
